Pile of Wood
Rayko has been chopping wood all day, now he must assemble the logs.

Write a program that reads a number - N - representing a number of wood logs - and calculates the height of the largest complete pile that can be built. Each row of the pile must have one log less than the previous one, or it will collapse. Examples:

N = 6               N = 5                                      N = 7
  *                   *                                          *
 * *                 * *                                        * * 
* * *               * *   (last row is incomplete)             * * *
height = 3         height = 2                                 *
                                                            height = 3
Input
Single line - N - the number of available wood logs.
Output
Single line - height - the largest possible height (don't draw the pile!)
