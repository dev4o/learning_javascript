Data Protector
You are beginning to resent your job as a Data Protector and why wouldn't you - just copying sequences of symbols over and over again. Data Protection is a mundane but important business - tough job, but somebody has to do it. While applying protection to the last two sequences, you notice something you haven't thought of before - it's the same process every time, just the symbols are different! For example, when you have the sequences 1 2 3 4 and a b c d, and the instructions 1 2, applying protection would mean just swapping everything between the first and second index (both inclusive) - so the protected sequences would be 1 b c 4 and a 2 3 d. And that's just the first level of protection, if there is another one with instructions 2 3, what would you get is (applied to the already protected sequences) 1 b 3 d and a 2 c 4. You start seeing the pattern and realize that if you automate this tedious process you'll never have to repeat it ever again!

There is one tricky part though - sometimes the instructions are reversed! With the sequences 1 2 3 4 5 and a b c d e and instructions 4 1 you need to swap the last ones (at index 4) and then jump to the front to finish with indices 0 and 1. You are a little confused at first but then you write down the results a b 3 4 e and 1 2 c d 5 and suddenly it all makes perfect sense!

Input
Exactly three lines:

first sequence (separated by a space)
second sequence (separated by a space)
instructions (pairs separated by commas) - S1 E1, S2 E2, ..., Sn En
Output
Exactly two lines:

first protected sequence (separated by a space)
second protected sequence (separated by a space)
Constraints
the two sequences are always the same length
there are no invalid indices
the two indices in a pair are always different
