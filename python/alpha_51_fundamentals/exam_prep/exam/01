Alien Message
Your task is to translate a message in some alien language (let's call it Alienski).

The message could be created by following simple rules and from two known languages, English and Spanish.

Each word in Alienski is constructed by subtracting the letters from English and Spanish (absolute value) and that is the resulting letter.

There are two special cases. If in each of the words the symbol is '-' (hyphen) or ' ' (space) it is mandatory for it to be kept this way.

There won't be a case with a '-' (hyphen) and a ' ' (space) at the same time.

If one of the words is with more letters than the other just add the letters from the longer word to the result.

Example:
talk
hablar
a b c d....
0 1 2 3.... 
t - h = | 19 - 7 | = 12 = m
a - a = | 0 - 0 | = 0 = a
l - b = | 11 - 1 | = 10 = k
k - l = | 10 - 11 | = 1 = b
empty - a = a
empty - r = r
Result:
